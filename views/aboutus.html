                            Patra’s school lunch programme to grow from feeding 1,500 children in the year 2000 to over
                            1.8 million children in 2019. On 11 February 2019, the organisation commemorated the serving

                            is a dire need for the school lunch programme to be replicated so that it realises the
                            vision that “No child in India shall be deprived of education because of hunger.”</p>
